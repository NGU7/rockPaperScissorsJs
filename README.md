# rockPaperScissorsJs
A program where a person goes against a computer in 5 matches of rock paper scissors

- getComputerChoice() function for random answer :
I plan to use the random() functions * 3 to decide what answer to choose from an array, and return the choice.
- playerSelection() function for obtaining users answer :
I plan to prompt the user for an answer, take the string ignoring case-sensitivity, and return the given answer.
- RPS() function used to run the choices against each other :
I plan to compare selections made using if and if else statements or using switch statements.
I plan to use a 'for' loop to keep track of how many times the game is played.
I plan to use an incrementor variable to keep count of the scores.

PT.2 CSS
- I intent to create the css for the display first before adding the js to it
- I plan to keep it simple with a "Choose your fighter!" centered at the top
- I plan to have 3 selections ready between rock paper and scissors
- and perhaps a display on the bottom updating depending on if you win or lose.

PT.3 javaScript
- create a function that resets the game after each player selection
- while also creating selectors and listeners to check if Rock paper or the scissors icon has been clicked on
- also i need to change the bottom text content to display whether you won or not.
- bottom text also needs to display how many times the player or computer won
- bottom text should also display the winner once comp or player gets 5 points
