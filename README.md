# rockPaperScissorsJs
A program where a person goes against a computer in 5 matches of rock paper scissors

- getComputerChoice() function for random answer :
I plan to use the random() functions * 3 to decide what answer to choose from an array, and return the choice.
- playerSelection() function for obtaining users answer :
I plan to prompt the user for an answer, take the string ignoring case-sensitivity, and return the given answer.
- game() function used to run the choices against each other :
I plan to compare selections made using if and if else statements or using switch statements.
I plan to use a 'for' loop to keep track of how many times the game is played.
I plan to use an incrementor variable to keep count of the scores.
